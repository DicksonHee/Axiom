,,00:50.0,Show,"Saoirse: I've sent you a profile of the target. Familiarize yourself with it, because this is not your run of the mill goon. They're going to have one hell of a mind, probably the most complex you've been in. ",,,,,,,,
,,00:59.7,Show,"It's likely they're trained in mind shielding, so your best bet is to know everything you can about them before you mindjump. The more you know about how this asshole ticks, the quicker you can get to the core and -",,,,,,,,

,,00:06.6,Show,Miles: She has memories of destroying a mind core.,,,,,,,,
,,00:09.2,Show,"Saoirse: Shit. That explains the spikes I'm seeing in her brain activity. Keep the chatter to a minimum. If she is a mindjumper, it won't take much for her to cotton on to your presence.",,,,,,,,

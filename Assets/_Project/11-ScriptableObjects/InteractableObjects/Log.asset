  objectName: SURVEILLANCE LOG NOTES
  objectDescription: "Monday  \n\n7.00am - Target arrived. Didn't enter building.
    Waiting for something? \n\n7.07am - Walked around premises in small circles.
    Scoping out environment? Came very close to surveillance spot. \n\n7.15am - Used
    keycard to enter building. Appeared to look directly at surveillance spot before
    entering. Surely coincidental. Have changed location regardless.\n\n6.38pm -
    No sign of target. Hasn't left building.\n\nTuesday \n\n12:14pm - Still no sign
    of target. Hasn't been seen leaving or entering building since yesterday morning.
    Scoped out entire building. No other exit seen.\n\n4:02pm - Truck arrived. Two
    employees exited building. Talked to driver. Boxes taken out of truck and taken
    inside. Truck left. License plate AZT8920. \n\n8:23pm - Target seen entering
    building. There must be another entry/exit point elsewhere. Can confirm it is
    not ground level."
